1️⃣ How does Logistic Regression differ from Linear Regression?
Linear Regression	Logistic Regression
Used for regression (continuous output)	Used for classification (categorical output)
Output is any real number	Output is probability (0–1)
Uses Least Squares (MSE)	Uses Log Loss (Cross-Entropy)
Fits a straight line	Uses sigmoid curve

Short interview answer:

Linear regression predicts continuous values, while logistic regression predicts class probabilities using the sigmoid function.

2️⃣ What is the Sigmoid Function?

The sigmoid (logistic) function is:

𝜎
(
𝑧
)
=
1
1
+
𝑒
−
𝑧
σ(z)=
1+e
−z
1
	​


It:

Converts any number into range 0 to 1

Produces an S-shaped curve

Interprets output as probability

Interview line:

The sigmoid function maps linear output into probability space between 0 and 1.

3️⃣ What is Precision vs Recall?
🔹 Precision
𝑃
𝑟

𝑃
𝑇
𝑃

𝐹
𝑃
Precision=
TP+FP
TP
	​


Out of predicted positives, how many were correct?

🔹 Recall
𝑅
𝑒
𝑐
𝑎
𝑙
𝑙
=
𝑇
𝑃
𝑇
𝑃
+
𝐹
𝑁
Recall=
TP+FN
TP
	​


Out of actual positives, how many did we correctly detect?

When to prioritize?

High Precision → Spam detection

High Recall → Disease detection

4️⃣ What is the ROC-AUC Curve?

ROC Curve:

X-axis → False Positive Rate

Y-axis → True Positive Rate

AUC:

Area under the ROC curve

Measures class separability

ROC Curve Example
4

Interpretation:

0.5 → Random

0.7–0.8 → Good

0.9+ → Excellent

5️⃣ What is a Confusion Matrix?

It compares actual vs predicted values.

	Predicted 0	Predicted 1
Actual 0	TN	FP
Actual 1	FN	TP
Visual Example
4

It helps calculate:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

6️⃣ What happens if classes are imbalanced?

If one class is much larger:

Accuracy becomes misleading

Model may predict majority class only

Example:

If 95% are negative:
Model predicts all negative → 95% accuracy 😬 but useless.

Solutions:

Use class_weight='balanced'

Use SMOTE (oversampling)

Use Precision/Recall instead of Accuracy

Adjust threshold

7️⃣ How do you choose the threshold?

Default threshold = 0.5

You adjust based on business needs:

Lower threshold → Higher Recall

Higher threshold → Higher Precision

Often chosen using:

ROC Curve

Precision-Recall Curve

Business cost analysis

8️⃣ Can Logistic Regression be used for Multi-class problems?

✅ Yes.

Two methods:

One-vs-Rest (OvR) – default in sklearn

Softmax (Multinomial Logistic Regression)
